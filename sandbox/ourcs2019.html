          The rise of privacy and security concerns of digital voice assistants has closely followed their growth in popularity. At the OurCS conference, our group aimed to study the privacy and security perceptions of Amazon Alexa device owners.

        <h5>Overview and Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          Issues in privacy and security are generating more traction than ever in a world now littered with voice assistants. However, perceptions of privacy surrounding these devices vary drastically. As such, our research workshop group at <a href=”https://www.cmu.edu/cs/ourcs/”>OurCS 2019</a> designed and ran a small study to determine which factors contribute to various privacy concerns of device owners.
        </p>

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <p>
          Our team began by listing potential research areas, then expanding on each with a narrower set of investigatory questions. We thought about the importance of one’s trust in the company of their voice assistant, differences in privacy perceptions between mobile and stand-alone devices, and topics such as device use based on privacy concerns (figure 1).

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1: List of potential topics to research</figcaption>
          </figure>

          After writing possible research questions for each of these topics, we settled on three hypotheses (figure 2):
          <ol>
            <li>People who have owned [Amazon Alexa] devices longer know more about their device privacy.</li>
            <li>People with higher education or technology expertise will have more knowledge on their device privacy.</li>
            <li>Device usage varies by a user’s level of knowledge on privacy.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>More privacy concerns leads to less device usage.</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

        <h5>The Study</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Study Design</h6>
        <p>
          While designing our survey for the study, we wrote all of our questions in a non-leading, straight-forward manner. In doing so, we ensured that questions probed at one topic at a time so our data would not be poorly impacted. Additionally, we included a short response question in our survey to help filter out fake data. Our questions focused on device privacy knowledge, device usage, and privacy concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Results</h6>
          Our survey was deployed to Amazon Mechanical Turk for one night, gathering 85 responses. After using RStudio to test our hypotheses, we found no significant p-values. Nevertheless, our findings shed light on two other areas of potential research:
          <ol>
            <li>Device privacy knowledge: 40% of participants did not know their devices had adjustable privacy settings.</li>
            <li>When asked five questions about the privacy of Amazon Alexa devices, on average only two were answered correctly.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          Although none of our p-values were significant, our research led to interesting findings. In the future, it could be beneficial to delve deeper into Amazon Alexa users’ level of privacy knowledge and expand our research to other voice assistants beyond Amazon devices.
