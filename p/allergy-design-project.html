        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Children with food allergies are a vulnerable group within our population. Young children may be nervous about having an allergic reaction and their peers without allergies pose a risk if they are unaware of their allergies. As such, our team at Bucknell University set out to create an electronic game for children to learn more about allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          Children who have food allergies are a very vulnerable group within our population. Younger children are unable to read labels on their own, their peers may not know about allergies, and coping with allergic reactions or the idea of having one can be daunting and anxiety-producing. With this in mind, our team of four Bucknell students set out to develop an electronic game to help children with allergies learn more about their allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Research</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Methodology and Intention</h6>
        <p>
          We conducted eight, one-hour qualitative interviews aiming to learn more about the lives of children with allergies, anxieties they may have, and their knowledge about their allergies. Before beginning, we wrote a list of assumptions that we wanted to test:

          <ol>
            <li>Children (6-10 years of age) carry their own allergy bags (with epinephrine, Benadryl, etc.)</li>
            <li>Children with food allergies likely have anxieties centered around their allergies</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Children with food allergies are nervous to eat food in public places if it is not a pre-made meal</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Children are starting to be independent when determining what they can eat and when reading labels</li>
            <li>Both children and their parents will want to help improve the child’s abilities to recognize foods with their allergies</li>
            <li>Parents allow children screen time (TV, phones, tablets, etc.) when home</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Findings</h6>
        After all of our interviews were complete, we noticed a few common themes. We devised a list of our key findings and sorted them by theme:
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Social</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Bullying by peers due to having allergies</li>
          <li>People without allergies are not as aware or concerned and tend to take allergies more lightly than they should</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Teachers, restaurants, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <u>Screentime</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents are hesitant to give children screen time</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Especially for non-educative purposes</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <u>Emotions</u>
        <ul>
          <li>There appears to be no correlation between a child’s allergy severity and their anxiety level surrounding their allergies</li>
        </ul>
        <u>Knowledge about allergy</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Most children knew about their allergies and what to look out for before the age of four</li>
        </ul>

        Our findings led to a breakthrough in our work: it didn’t seem that children with allergies in our age range needed to learn more about their allergies. In fact, it appears that their peers <em>without allergies</em> have the least amount of knowledge about allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">New Scope</h6>
        <p>
          At this point, we realized our game should focus on teaching children without allergies about allergies instead of teaching children with allergies what they already know. We also shifted our age range down to 4-8.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Game Ideation</h6>
          After switching gears, our group began brainstorming different games to address our problem (figure 1). Our favorite idea was one that combines a grocery store scavenger hunt and cooking.
          <figure>

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1: Ideas for our game</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Chosen Game: Food Store Scavenger Hunt</h6>
          In our game, players choose from several characters with different allergies and are given a four-ingredient recipe their selected character enjoys. At least one of these ingredients could contain the character’s allergen so players have to be cautious. Once all of the ingredients have been collected, players scan them with their device and are congratulated or told to try again if they scanned an ingredient with an allergen. If they are successful, then they cook the food and can watch their character eat it. Our wireframe is shown in figure 2.

          </figure>
        </p>

        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Before we could move forward into full app production, we wanted to test our game concept. We decided that a low-fidelity prototype would be sufficient. We turned our wireframe into a Wizard of Oz prototype with three characters, then constructed a shorter version for the scavenger hunt user test (figure 3).

            <br>Note: "fish" changed to "seafood" in recipe after first day of user testing</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <h5>User Testing</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Set Up</h6>
        <p>
          Luckily, our university is in close proximity to the <a href=”https://www.lewisburgchildrensmuseum.org/”>Lewisburg Children’s Museum</a> where there exists a mini grocery store to test our game (figure 4).
          <figure>
            <img class="mt-2 mb-1 img-fluid" src="photos/allergy-design/LCM_weis_fullpano.jpeg" alt="Panorama of the mini Weis Food Market in the Lewisburg Children's Museum">
            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 4: The Lewisburg Children's Museum: the mini Weis Food Market</figcaption>
          </figure>

          There were three total days of user testing, the first being a trial run with no measurements taken. During the tests, each participant received a packet with a character and recipe. We also attached a GoPro to their shopping cart to observe how they play the game and differentiate between allergen-prone ingredients (figure 5). There were no incentives to play provided so that we could gage interest in the game itself.

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 5: Our cart and GoPro set-up</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>


        <p>
          <h6>Results</h6>
          The game proved popular as many of the children wanted to play, with a few requesting to play again. Additionally, prior to playing almost no participants knew what food allergies are, supporting our choice to focus on children without allergies. Our group plans to analyze the videos in January when we return from our holiday break.
