        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Children with food allergies are a vulnerable group within our population. Young children may be nervous about having an allergic reaction and their peers without allergies pose a risk if they are unaware of their allergies. As such, our team at Bucknell University set out to create an electronic game for children to learn more about allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          Food allergies have become increasingly common across the United States and other parts of the world in the past few decades. Moreover, children who have food allergies are a very vulnerable group within this population. Younger children are unable to read labels on their own, their peers may not know about allergies, and coping with allergic reactions or the idea of having one can be daunting and anxiety-producing. With this in mind, our team of four Bucknell students set out to develop an electronic game to help children with allergies learn more about their allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Research</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Methodology and Intention</h6>
        <p>
          We conducted eight, one-hour qualitative interviews aiming to learn more about the lives of children with allergies, anxieties they may have, and their knowledge about their allergies. Four interviews involved one parent and their child with an allergy and four were with just an adult who either has an allergy themselves or has plentiful experience with children with allergies.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Assumptions</h6>
        Before beginning our interviews, we wrote a list of assumptions that we wanted to test:
        <ol>
          <li>Children (6-10 years of age) carry their own allergy bags (with epinephrine, Benadryl, etc.)</li>
          <li>Children with food allergies likely have anxieties centered around their allergies</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Children with food allergies are nervous to eat food in public places if it is not a pre-made meal</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Children are starting to be independent when determining what they can eat and when reading labels</li>
          <li>Both children and their parents will want to help improve the child’s abilities to recognize foods with their allergies</li>
          <li>Parents allow children screen time (TV, phones, tablets, etc.) when home</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Findings</h6>
        After all of our interviews were complete, we noticed a few common themes. We devised a list of our key findings and sorted them by theme:
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>Social</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Bullying by peers due to having allergies</li>
          <li>People without allergies are not as aware or concerned and tend to take allergies more lightly than they should</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Teachers, restaurants, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <u>Screentime</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Parents are hesitant to give children screen time</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Especially for non-educative purposes</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <u>Emotions</u>
        <ul>
          <li>There appears to be no correlation between a child’s allergy severity and their anxiety level surrounding their allergies</li>
          <li>Internal sadness felt when can’t eat what others can</li>
        </ul>
        <u>Knowledge about allergy</u>
        <ul>
          <li>Most children knew about their allergies and what to look out for by the age of four</li>
        </ul>
        While some of our assumptions were correct, a few of our findings surprised us. For instance, we assumed that children would only become more independent in handling their allergies between the ages of 6-10. However, our interviews show that many of these children begin to handle allergies on their own by the age of two and three (i.e. asking if their allergen is in different foods, knowing what their allergen looks like, etc.). Additionally, children are not as prone to anxiety as we assumed. This led to a breakthrough in our work: it didn’t seem that children with allergies in our age range needed to learn more about their allergies. In fact, from our interviews it appears that their peers <em>without allergies</em> have the least amount of knowledge about allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Ideation</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">New Scope</h6>
        <p>
          At this point, it was clear that our game should focus on the actual need of helping children without allergies learn more about allergies instead of teaching children with allergies what they already know. We also shifted the scope of our age group down to 4-8 years of age, which means that our game has to be picture-heavy as opposed to text-heavy.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Game Ideation</h6>
        After switching gears, our group began brainstorming different games to address our problem (figure 1). We thought about writing interactive books, developing puzzle games, and even a birthday party planning application, but our favorite idea was one that combines a food-market scavenger hunt and cooking.

          <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1: Ideas for our game, messily written down</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Chosen Game: Food Store Scavenger Hunt</h6>
        In our game, children are given a choice of several characters with a variety of food allergies. Tied to each character are three different recipes to choose from. Each recipe has four ingredients, with at least one ingredient that could have a character’s allergen in it. After children initially choose a character, the application quickly explains their allergy, what they can and cannot eat, and what an allergic reaction is (e.g. “I will get sick if I eat X”). Once a child finds all of the ingredients needed, they can scan each item to check it off the list. If they scan an ingredient with an allergen, the app shows the character explaining that they cannot eat the ingredient and to try again. They are also told to try again if an ingredient not listed in the recipe is scanned. Once all items are scanned successfully, they can add the virtual version of each ingredient into a mixing bowl and cook the requested food. Our wireframe of the game is shown in figure 2.

        </p>

        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
        Before we could move forward into full app production, we wanted to build a prototype to test our game. Considering that we only want to test the concept of our game, we decided that a low-fidelity prototype would be sufficient. In order to facilitate group collaboration, we used Google Slides to create a Wizard of Oz prototype with three characters (figure 3), and quickly tested the usability and game flow amongst ourselves and friends. The game felt usable and the flow was natural, so we began converting the full game prototype into a shorter version for user-testing the main portion of the game, the scavenger hunt.

        </figure>
        </p>

        <h5>User Testing</h5>
        <p>
          Luckily, our university is in close proximity to the <a href=”https://www.lewisburgchildrensmuseum.org/”>Lewisburg Children’s Museum</a> where there exists a mini grocery store in which the director allowed us to test our game (figure 4).
          <figure>

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 4: The Lewisburg Children's Museum: the mini Weis Food Market</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
        We shortened our prototype to five screens: a character description, recipe ingredient list, and three feedback pages (figure 5). The character description and recipe would be printed and given to participants to carry out the store with them as they search for ingredients.
        <figure>

          <figcaption class="caption">Figure 5: The pages of the game packet given to particpants of our first user test</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        We planned a total of three tests: the first as a run-through with no recordings or measurements being taken, and two measured user-tests with video recordings. On a busy Saturday in December of 2019, our group stood in the Museum’s grocery store and let children know that there was a scavenger hunt available if they were interested. There were no incentives provided in order to gage interest in the game itself, and our game prove to be very popular anyway. We even had two participants request to play another round.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the second and third day of user-testing, we set up our video equipment to observe how children play the game and watch how they differentiate between allergen-prone ingredients. A GoPro was attached to the top of small shopping carts that the museum supplied and was set to view both the inside of the cart and its peripheral surroundings (figure 6). In this manner we could better document how children choose ingredients. Additionally, going into our third day of user testing, we only changed one thing. In our recipe we renamed “fish” to “seafood” to ensure that participants had to discern between the seafood with and without allergens. Our game still appeared to be entertaining for the children, and our team looks forward to analyzing the data in the upcoming semester.

        </figure>
        </p>

        <h5>Future Plans</h5>
        <p>
        As the first semester of our year-long project draws to a close, we have set forth plans on what we will do next semester. When we come back from December break in January, we will analyze our user data and determine whether we should move forward with the application or move towards another idea. From initial observations, it seems that our game is working as intended: children appear to differentiate between the fish and crabs/shellfish in the grocery store’s bin and choose the one without a shell (i.e. the fish). Plus, out of the numerous children who have participated in our game, only two have known what a food allergy is before playing. Nonetheless, we will delve into this at the start of the next semester in January.
