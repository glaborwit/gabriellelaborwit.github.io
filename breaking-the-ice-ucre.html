        <h5>Overview and Problem Space</h5>
        <p>
        <p>
          The COVID-19 pandemic has affected both people and businesses in numerous ways. <b>For theater venues in particular, the pandemic has made it increasingly difficult to connect with their local communities.</b>
          Places like the Kelly Strayhorn Theater, a performing arts theater local to Pittsburgh, PA, are no exception.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, our team spent two months researching ways to recreate the meaningful interactions that
          were once only experienced through in-person theater activities. The result of our research efforts is a set
          of guidelines for hosting a series of workshops related to a theme of the theater’s choosing. Our guidelines
          are highly customizable so theaters like the Kelly Strayhorn can host events that fit their ever-changing
          needs and budgets.
        </p>
        </p>

        <h5>Methods</h5>
        <p>
          Early in our process, we discovered people’s needs and concerns through <b>Semi-Structured Interviews</b>,
          <b>Contextual Inquiry</b>, and <b>Think Aloud Protocols</b>. <b>Speed Dating</b> further validated our goals
          and the user needs we had uncovered, and supported us in generating potential design directions. Lastly,
          testing our <b>experience prototypes</b> with groups helped us iterate on our ideas and eventually confirm the
          success of our final product.

        <h5>Insights and Evidence</h5>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>People like structured activities</li>
            <ul>
              <li>They help them avoid uncomfortable moments that may arise</li>
            </ul>
            <li>People are motivated to get to know other people on a more personal level</li>
            <li>People’s background knowledge shapes their online experience in how comfortable they are when interacting
              with others</li>
            <li>People like to participate in activities that are fun and not difficult (i.e. little mental or physical
              preparation required)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>“I like it when we can all just participate and have fun, where the stakes are low.”
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>

        <h5>Solution</h5>
        <p>
          Using the data from our research, we know individual workshops are most successful when set up with the following structure:
          <ol>
            <li>Workshops should start out with a few rounds of well-structured, small-group icebreakers. To achieve this, hosts should create several ice breaker question card decks for groups to parse through.</li>
            <li>Next, participants should all meet together again to learn about the workshop’s topic from an expert on the subject. It’s essential for the performer to encourage audience interaction here to continue fostering the relationships being formed.</li>
            <li>Lastly, participants should break into groups again to do some fun hands-on activities to put what they learned into practice.</li>
          </ol>
          Together, these guidelines can help focus events on creating meaningful interactions rather than completing the actual activity, allowing communities to stay connected both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
