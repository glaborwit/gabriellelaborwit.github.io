          Children with food allergies are a vulnerable group within our population and could be at risk due to their peers' lack of knowledge surrounding allergies. As such, our team created a game for children to learn more about allergies.
        </h4>

        <img class="img-fluid mb-1" src="photos/allergy-design/shelly.png" alt="Allergy Design Independent Study">
        <br>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          As the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3027063.3049270">literature</a> <a href="http://francisconunes.me/papers/Aluvathingal2018.pdf">shows</a>, people with food allergies, particularly children, are a vulnerable group within our population. Young children may be nervous about having an allergic reaction, may be unable to read food labels on their own, and their peers without allergies pose a risk if they are unaware of their food allergies. As such, our student team at Bucknell University set out to create an electronic game for children to learn more about food allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Initial Research</h5>
        <p>
          We conducted eight qualitative interviews aiming to learn more about the lives of children with food allergies, including their knowledge about their allergies as well as any resulting anxieties. We compiled a list of assumptions to test during the interviews and in the process we discovered that we were targeting the wrong population. We had hypothesized that children with food allergies would need to learn more about their condition; however, our interviews revealed that children without food allergies are the least informed, increasing the potential harm to those with food allergies.
        </p>

        <h5>Game Ideation</h5>
        <p>
          After changing our scope to children of four to eight years of age without allergies, our group began brainstorming game ideas (Figure 1).
          <figure>
            <img class="mt-2 mb-1 img-fluid" src="photos/allergy-design/game_ideation.jpeg" alt="game ideas on whiteboard">
            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 1: Ideas for our game</figcaption>
          </figure>

          We chose a grocery store scavenger hunt game where players pick from several characters with different food allergies. Then, they must find recipe ingredients that are safe for their character to eat. Once the ingredients have been collected, players scan them with their device and are congratulated if they avoided all allergenic foods; otherwise, they try again. Our wireframe is shown in Figure 2.

          </figure>

        </p>

        <h5>Prototyping</h5>
        <p>
          Before moving into full app production, we wanted to test our game concept. We decided that a low-fidelity prototype would be sufficient. We turned our wireframe into a Wizard of Oz prototype on Google Slides with three characters, then constructed a shorter version for the user test (Figure 3).

          </figure>
        </p>

        <h5>User Testing</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Set Up</h6>
        <p>
          Luckily, our university is in close proximity to the <a href=”https://www.lewisburgchildrensmuseum.org/”>Lewisburg Children’s Museum</a> where there exists a mini grocery store to test our game (Figure 4).
          <figure>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          During the tests, each participant received a packet with a character and a recipe (refer back to Figure 3). We attached a GoPro to their shopping cart to observe how they play the game and differentiate between allergenic and non-allergenic ingredients (Figure 5). There were no incentives provided to participate so that we could gage interest in the game itself.

        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Results</h6>
          The game proved popular as many of the children wanted to play, with a few requesting to play again. Additionally, almost no participants knew about allergies, supporting our choice to focus on children without any. Our group plans to analyze the videos mid-January when we return from our holiday break.
