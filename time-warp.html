        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>
          Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that will likely be commonplace in the upcoming years. My goal for this project was to utilize that technology to enhance the human senses. In particular, I created an AR program that would slow down time: users could tap their finger and watch reality go into slow-motion.
        </p>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          The summer of 2018 I spent two months conducting research in Munich, Germany through the <a href="https://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/program-overview/">International Research Experiences for Students</a> (IRES) program funded by the National Science Foundation. Going into the project, my graduate mentor, <a href=“https://www.pascalknierim.de/”>Pascal Knierim</a>, and I were motivated to build something that would heighten the human senses in a way that was not able to be done with traditional technologies. We decided that time warp would be a great way to amplify sight and was feasible to develop with an AR device such as the Microsoft Hololens.
        </p>

        <h5>Use Cases</h5>
        <p>
          Humans only perceive motion in one way. Our slow-motion viewing prototype overcomes this limitation by allowing humans to perceive motion in an entirely new manner. In a factory, employees can use the technology to better diagnose machine malfunctions. Dancers can use the technology for expedited choreography learning. In summary, our prototype allows for the <b>derivation of exact information from high-speed situations</b>, making problem-solving, imitation, and skill-building easier.
        </p>

        <h5>The Design Process</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Supplies and Technology</h6>
        <p>
          I began the project by discussing with my mentor ways in which slow-motion could be achieved with the lab’s available technology. As the application is designed for people who own a Hololens device, we wanted any add-on technology to be minimal and noninvasive. Thus, the Hololens’ built-in camera was the most practical option and was used to feed live video into an overlay on the Hololens display (figure 1).

        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Designing Slow-Motion</h6>
          The next step was to create the effect of slow-motion. After storing live video footage in memory, I was able to slowly play parts of it back in the overlay. This step required a significant amount of experimentation with the frame playback rate to make the slow motion appear natural (figure 2).

          </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h6>Transition Effects</h6>
          After several attempts and feedback from my mentor and lab peers, a natural slow-motion effect was achieved. I was then faced with the challenge of choosing appropriate transition effects when toggling between slow-motion and live video, deemed “reality mode”. The shift from reality to slow-motion, was simple: it looked most natural to immediately slow footage down with no transition. The harder problem was designing the shift from slow-motion to reality; the transition had to be subtle but clear. To solve this, I observed the ways that movies and videos that involve slow-motion transition back to real-time footage. It seemed that the most realistic choice would be to play the remaining slow-motion footage at double the normal speed until it caught up to reality (figure 3).

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 3: Designing the transitions between slow-motion and reality</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Indicators</h6>
        Lastly, I had to find a way to indicate whether a user was in slow-motion or reality mode. Sticking with the theme of time warp, I designed a small clock in the corner with a second hand that ticks at a normal speed when in reality mode, a noticeably slow speed when in slow-motion, and fast when transitioning from slow-motion to reality mode.
        </p>

        <h5>User Study</h5>
        <p>
          Upon completing the prototype (figure 4), I directed a user study in which participants utilized our program to perform certain tasks. Then, they took a survey about their experience with the program, its features, and use-cases that they see fit for the technology.

        <h5>Poster Presentation</h5>
        <p>
          I was able to present a poster and give a small demonstration of the application at Multimodal Interaction in Augmented and Virtual Reality (WeimARVR) in Weimar, Germany towards the end of that July (figure 5).
