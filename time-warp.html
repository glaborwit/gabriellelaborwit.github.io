          Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that will likely be commonplace in the upcoming years. My goal for this project was to utilize AR technology to enhance the human senses by creating a program that would slow down time.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          The summer of 2018 I spent two months conducting research in Munich, Germany through the <a href="https://hciunh.org/hci-ubicomp-ires/program-overview/">International Research Experiences for Students</a> (IRES) program funded by the National Science Foundation. Going into the project, my graduate mentor, <a href="https://www.pascalknierim.de/">Pascal Knierim</a>, and I were motivated to build something that would heighten the human senses in a way that was not able to be done with traditional technologies. We decided to amplify sight by building an augmented reality program where users could tap their fingers and watch reality go into slow motion.
        </p>

        <h5>Use Cases</h5>
        <p>
          Humans only perceive motion in one way. Our slow-motion viewing prototype overcomes this limitation by allowing humans to perceive motion in an entirely new manner. In a factory, employees can use the technology to better diagnose machine malfunctions. Dancers can use the technology to expedite the process of learning new choreography. In summary, our prototype allows for the <b>derivation of exact information</b> from high-speed situations, making problem-solving, imitation, and skill-building easier.
        </p>

        <h5>The Design Process</h5>
        <h6 style="margin-top:0px">Designing Slow Motion</h6>
        <p>
          The first step in producing the application was to create the effect of slow motion. I used the Hololens’ built-in camera to stream live video footage into an overlay on the Hololens display (Figure 1).
          <figure>
            <video class="img-fluid square mt-2" controls muted src="photos/time-warp/live_feed_overlay.mp4" type="video/mp4">

            <figcaption class = "caption">Figure 1: Overlaying Hololens camera feed as user's view</figcaption>
          </figure>

          Then, I started storing the footage in memory and slowly played it back in the overlay. This required a significant amount of experimentation with playback rates to make the slow motion appear as natural as possible (Figure 2).

            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 2: First attempt at creating slow-motion</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h6>Transition Effects</h6>
          After several attempts and feedback from my mentor and lab peers, a natural slow-motion effect was achieved. I was then faced with the challenge of choosing appropriate transition effects when toggling between slow motion and live video, deemed “reality mode”. The shift from reality to slow motion was simple: it looked most natural to immediately slow footage down with no transition. The harder problem was designing the shift from slow motion to reality; this transition had to be subtle but clear. To solve this, I observed movies and videos that involve transitions from slow motion to reality. It seemed that the most realistic choice would be to play the remaining slow-motion footage at double the normal speed until it caught up to reality (Figure 3).
          <figure>
            <img class="img-fluid mt-2 mb-1" src="photos/time-warp/slow_mo_transition_notes.jpg" alt="Notes detailing the slow-motion effect">
            <figcaption class="caption">Figure 3: Designing the transitions between slow-motion and reality</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h6>Indicators</h6>
        Lastly, I had to find a way to indicate whether a user was in slow motion or reality mode. Sticking with the theme of time warp, I designed a small clock in the corner with a second hand that ticks at a normal speed when in reality mode, a noticeably slow speed when in slow motion, and fast when transitioning from slow motion to reality mode.
        </p>

        <h5>User Study</h5>
        <p>
          Upon completing the prototype (Figure 4), I directed a user study in which participants utilized our program to perform certain tasks. Then, they took a survey about their experience with the program, its features, and use cases that they saw fit for the technology.

        </p>

        <h5>Poster Presentation</h5>
        <p>
          I was able to present a poster and give a small demonstration of the application at Multimodal Interaction in Augmented and Virtual Reality (WeimARVR) in Weimar, Germany towards the end of that July (Figure 5).
